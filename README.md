# string-analyzer
> A set of API endpoints to examine a string carefully, and interpret it into meaningful data

These files collectively create a RESTful API service dedicated to analyzing strings and persisting their computed properties. Don't worry about the file count (the magic of the chosen framework, and perhaps a bit of my own clever organization ðŸ˜‰) made it all possible

This service exposes several endpoints, allowing for string analysis, storage, retrieval, and even some cool filtering capabilities.
